Feature: calculus

  The production realization calculus: its closed syntax, canonical identity, kernel-checked denotation, realization library, and Rust profile (§17.14).

  @TC-01 @build
  Scenario: Hand-constructed target programs have canonical bytes and a SHA-256 content identity, alpha-equivalent programs canonicalize to identical bytes and identity, an ill-typed program has neither, and every committed fixture validates against the target schemas.
    Given every committed fixture under `compiler/fixtures/`
    When each is reread, renamed by an injective renaming of its locals, loaded, and run by the reference interpreter
    Then the committed bytes are canonical and schema-valid, every renaming has the same canonical bytes, identity, and outcome
    And a change that is not a renaming changes the identity, and an ill-typed program has no canonical form and no identity

  @TC-02 @build
  Scenario: Every malformed target program or violated static rule fails closed with LLB6005, and an invalid program has neither a canonical form nor a rendering.
    Given a valid target program
    When it is made malformed, given an unbound local, an ill-typed body, a nonexhaustive or redundant match, a wrong arity, an undeclared function or ADT, an out-of-range or noncanonical literal, a closure over every parameter, or a primitive outside its signature
    Then each load fails with LLB6005 naming the violated rule
    And the invalid program also has no Rust rendering, while the valid one loads and renders

  @TC-03 @build
  Scenario: The calculus denotation is a kernel-checked LexLean definition that charges every evaluator operation, Lean's kernel reduces every kernel-reducible fixture to its expected outcome with its exact step count, no fixture program is stuck on its stated arguments or on seeded random well-typed arguments at any sampled fuel, and a wrong expected outcome is rejected by Lean.
    Given the `compiler` project and its generated `TargetFixtures` module
    When the project is verified under pinned Lean, every fixture program is run on seeded random well-typed arguments at sampled fuels, and a copy stating one wrong expected outcome is verified
    Then every kernel-reducible fixture has a theorem the kernel proves, the module equals its generator, and no run is stuck
    And the copy fails with LLV7002 on the wrong outcome

  @TC-04 @build
  Scenario: Lean's evaluator, running the published calculus sources compiled again by pinned Lean, reproduces every fixture's expected outcome and step count, including fixtures a reflexivity proof cannot decide, and the comparison refuses a fixture stated one step off.
    Given the verified `compiler` project
    When pinned Lean compiles the published calculus sources again and evaluates every fixture's `Run` definition
    Then every printed outcome equals the fixture's expected outcome, steps included
    And the same comparison refuses an evaluator-only fixture whose stated outcome is one step off

  @TC-05 @build
  Scenario: Every realization library template has a fixture whose outcome the kernel proves equal to the value LexLean's own collection primitive computes, committed instances equal their templates, and a mutated template is rejected by Lean.
    Given every library fixture and its oracle term
    When each committed instance is compared with its template, and a copy with a mutated `set_insert` instance is verified
    Then every template has a fixture, its instance equals the template, and an `Agrees` theorem states LexLean's own result
    And the mutated instance fails its `Agrees` theorem under pinned Lean

  @TC-06 @build
  Scenario: Every runtime construct of the production registry has exactly one realization row naming existing calculus elements and requires allocation exactly when its realization does, and the fixtures exercise every calculus type, literal, expression, shape, primitive, and template, and every fixed-width primitive at every width it admits.
    Given the production registry's runtime rows and the realization table
    When the table is checked against the registry, each row's allocation is compared with its realization's, and every element and typed (primitive, width) pair the fixtures use is collected
    Then the table and the runtime rows are in bijection, every reference exists, and every row's allocation equals its realization's
    And no calculus element and no admitted (primitive, width) pair is left unexercised, and a missing or extra row is rejected

  @TC-07 @build
  Scenario: Every fixture with an observable outcome renders to a safe Rust library crate in rust-std, and in rust-core exactly when it needs no heap, that the pinned rustc compiles with warnings denied, that prints exactly the denotation's value or overflow, and whose counted work never exceeds the denotation's steps; planted value and work discrepancies are detected.
    Given every fixture whose outcome is a value without a closure or an overflow, and the pinned rustc
    When each is rendered as a library crate in both profiles where it can be, compiled with its harness by rustc with warnings denied, and run
    Then rust-core renders exactly the fixtures that need no heap, and each run prints the denotation's observable outcome and a work count no greater than its steps
    And a wrapping addition or a Euclidean quotient planted in a rendering changes the printed outcome, and a quadratic append exceeds the steps
