# UORC GitHub Issue Backlog (Spec 1.0-draft.2)

Purpose: define the complete implementation work as granular GitHub issues for
`UOR-Foundation/compression`, with explicit Definition of Done and acceptance
criteria for each issue.

Scope baseline:
- Specification: `SPEC(3).md` (`UORC-IMPLEMENTATION-SPEC-001`, rev `1.0-draft.2`)
- Machine profile: `uorc/reference-machine/2` (profile byte `02`)
- Archive format: `uorc/archive/1`
- Delivery discipline: PrismPM rigor and template universal policy (`AGENTS.md`)

Issue authoring conventions:
- Labels suggested in each issue body are required for triage consistency.
- Every issue references owning claim IDs once the UORC register is populated.
- Every issue adds or updates at least one scenario under `features/suites/`.
- No issue closes without passing `just vv` in the locked SDK environment.

## Epic 0: Program setup and repository publication

### Issue 0001 - Create repository and enforce baseline protections

Suggested labels: `program`, `repo-setup`, `security`, `governance`

Problem:
The target repository `github.com/UOR-Foundation/compression` does not exist yet.
We need a governed repository baseline before implementation issues execute.

Tasks:
1. Create the GitHub repository under `UOR-Foundation` as `compression`.
2. Set default branch protections (review + required status checks + no force push).
3. Enable Actions with least privilege defaults.
4. Configure CODEOWNERS/review settings aligned with UOR policy.
5. Wire repository metadata (description/topics/license visibility).

Definition of Done:
- Repository exists and is accessible at the target URL.
- Branch protections are active and verified by attempted policy violation.
- Required checks include at least the bootstrap/verification gate intended for PRs.
- Repository settings are captured in a committed governance note.

Acceptance Criteria:
- `gh repo view UOR-Foundation/compression` resolves successfully.
- A test branch push violating policy is rejected with expected GitHub diagnostics.
- A PR to default branch requires configured review and checks.

### Issue 1403 - Integrate external comparator toolchain (zstd, brotli, xz, cmix)

Suggested labels: `benchmarks`, `comparators`, `oracles`

Problem:
Public-comparison plans require immutable comparator bindings and reconstruction checks.

Tasks:
1. Acquire pinning + license/provenance manifests for each comparator.
2. Implement invocation adapters for default and high-ratio plans.
3. Validate each comparator output by full reconstruction compare.

Definition of Done:
- Comparator results are complete, reproducible, and not silently omitted.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Failed/time-out comparators are reported explicitly, never dropped.

### Issue 1404 - Implement early feasibility gate and reporting

Suggested labels: `benchmarks`, `feasibility`, `risk`

Problem:
Spec requires pre-release feasibility evidence for synthesis/resource behavior.

Tasks:
1. Run required scale ladder and store trace tests.
2. Produce measured reports including candidate counts and work partitions.
3. Classify outcomes exactly (`compressed`, `raw_best_found`, etc.).

Definition of Done:
- Feasibility output identifies blockers without claim inflation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Reports include both logical and physical observations with exact status semantics.

---

### Issue 1405 - Execute mandatory public benchmark plans and publish results

Suggested labels: `benchmarks`, `reporting`, `release`

Problem:
Implementation acceptance requires running complete mandatory plans with honest reporting.

Tasks:
1. Execute `public-default` and `public-ratio` plans.
2. Publish canonical results including accounting scope and claim disposition.
3. Update open-claim ledger statuses without overstatement.

Definition of Done:
- Full mandatory benchmark evidence exists in repository artifacts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Results include unsuccessful outcomes where present.
- No benchmark omission occurs without explicit typed failure status.

## Epic 15: Diagnostics and negative coverage completeness

### Issue 1501 - Implement complete `UCxxxx` diagnostic inventory and schemas

Suggested labels: `diagnostics`, `api`, `quality`

Problem:
Public failures must be typed, stable, and field-scoped.

Tasks:
1. Implement all diagnostic classes/codes from section 18.2.
2. Add stable reason enums and stage/field metadata.
3. Document mapping to owning claims/scenarios.

Definition of Done:
- Public errors are deterministic, typed, and bounded.

Acceptance Criteria:
- No fallback generic error for covered paths.
- Error text/content does not leak unbounded external outputs.

---

### Issue 1502 - Add one owning negative test for every public diagnostic

Suggested labels: `testing`, `diagnostics`, `conformance`

Problem:
Every diagnostic must be reachable by its own intentionally targeted failure.

Tasks:
1. Add negative fixtures for each `UC` code.
2. Ensure failure reaches intended validator stage (not earlier parser failure).
3. Verify tests fail red/green on planted mutations.

Definition of Done:
- Diagnostic coverage is complete and non-vacuous.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Matrix report maps each diagnostic to at least one dedicated test case.

## Epic 16: Formal theorem closure

### Issue 1601 - Implement and check full theorem inventory from section 19

Suggested labels: `proof`, `formal`, `acceptance`

Problem:
Spec mandates named theorem inventory with specific statements.

Tasks:
1. Implement all required theorem statements and proofs.
2. Ensure theorem names/mappings remain traceable from docs/register.
3. Run kernel checking and axiom audits in gate.

Definition of Done:
- Theorem inventory is complete and checked under declared policy.

Acceptance Criteria:
- No missing theorem from table in section 19.
- No forbidden axioms/holes/tactic escapes.

---

### Issue 1602 - Add kernel-instance fixtures for required closed examples

Suggested labels: `proof`, `fixtures`, `evidence`

Problem:
Certain fixtures require closed instance modules verified via Lean and checker.

Tasks:
1. Generate instance modules binding exact query/archive/certificate bytes.
2. Verify with elaboration + `leanchecker`.
3. Report runtime-check vs kernel-instance evidence kinds distinctly.

Definition of Done:
- Required kernel-instance evidence exists and is reproducible.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Fixtures flagged `kernel_instance` include actual checked modules and transcripts.

---

## Epic 17: CI, release gate, reproducibility, mutation testing

### Issue 1701 - Expand `just vv` to include full UORC mandatory gates

Suggested labels: `ci`, `verification`, `release`

Problem:
Current scaffold gate does not yet include UORC-specific proof/oracle/benchmark obligations.

Tasks:
1. Add all mandatory phases from section 25 in logical dependency order.
2. Keep `just vv` as single complete acceptance boundary.
3. Provide subset commands clearly marked non-release.

Definition of Done:
- `just vv` enforces all required UORC acceptance obligations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Release readiness cannot be asserted without green `just vv`.

---

### Issue 1702 - Implement mutation-evidence suite tied to owning gates

Suggested labels: `ci`, `mutation`, `quality`

Problem:
Every critical gate must prove it can fail on representative defects.

Tasks:
1. Define mutation classes per section 24/26 requirements.
2. Add automation that runs red/green mutation checks.
3. Record evidence mapping mutation to owning gate.

Definition of Done:
- Gate quality is demonstrably non-vacuous.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Mutation matrix includes expected rejecting gate for each class.

---

### Issue 1703 - Add clean-path reproducibility and identity comparison checks

Suggested labels: `reproducibility`, `ci`, `supply-chain`

Problem:
Build reproducibility and identity boundaries must be checked from clean roots.

Tasks:
1. Execute dual absolute-path clean builds with isolated outputs.
2. Compare canonical artifacts and declared platform-bound normalized artifacts.
3. Reject disallowed normalization masking semantic drift.

Definition of Done:
- Reproducibility checks are automated and policy-enforced.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Deliberate semantic drift mutation is detected despite normalization.

---

## Epic 18: Release readiness and publication evidence

### Issue 1801 - Produce UORC release acceptance dossier for v1 profile-02

Suggested labels: `release`, `compliance`, `documentation`

Problem:
Need one auditable package proving all mandatory implementation obligations are complete.

Tasks:
1. Assemble proof/oracle/benchmark/claim inventory summary.
2. Include unresolved/open claims explicitly.
3. Bind dossier to exact source/compiler/SDK identities.

Definition of Done:
- Reviewers can decide implementation acceptance from one canonical dossier.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dossier includes explicit yes/no for each mandatory requirement class.
- Open performance/record claims remain open unless evidence changes their state.
